# 📝 HASHTAG QUICK REFERENCE

## How to Tag Your Events

Simply add a hashtag **anywhere in your event title** in Google Calendar:

### 🔴 Tests/Exams
Add any of these to make the event **RED**:
- `#Test`
- `#מבחן`
- `#t`
- `#מ`

**Example:**
```
Math Final Exam #Test
```
Will display as: **"Math Final Exam"** (in red)

---

### 🟣 Special/Important Events
Add any of these to make the event **PURPLE**:
- `#Other`
- `#אחר`
- `#o`
- `#א`

**Example:**
```
Field Trip to Museum #Other
```
Will display as: **"Field Trip to Museum"** (in purple)

## ✨ What Happens

1. **The hashtag and everything after it is HIDDEN** from display
2. **Event gets colored** (red for tests, purple for special)
3. **Markers appear** in month/week views
4. **You can filter** to show only tests in Settings

## 💡 Pro Tips

✅ **Put hashtag at the end**: `Event Name #Test`
✅ **Use short codes**: `#t` or `#מ` for quick typing
✅ **Case doesn't matter**: `#test` and `#Test` both work
✅ **Works in Hebrew**: `#מבחן` and `#מ` both work

❌ **Don't put important info after hashtag** - it will be hidden!
